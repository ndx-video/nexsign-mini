# **nexSign mini (NSM) Commercial License**

This document outlines the option for obtaining a commercial license for the nexSign mini (NSM) software.

## When Do I Need a Commercial License?

The NSM software is licensed by default under the **GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)**, a "copyleft" license. You are free to use it under the terms of the GPLv3, which includes the obligation to share your source code if you distribute a modified version or a program that links to it.

You will need a **commercial license** if your use case does not allow you to meet the GPLv3 obligations. Common commercial use cases include:

* Distributing NSM as part of a proprietary, closed-source application.
* Integrating NSM into a hardware device where you do not wish to (or cannot) share the full source code for the device's firmware.
* Wanting to receive commercial-grade support and maintenance from NDX Pty Ltd.

## Acquiring a Commercial License

The commercial license grants you a "GPL exception," freeing you from the copyleft requirements of the GPLv3 and allowing you to embed NSM in your proprietary products.
