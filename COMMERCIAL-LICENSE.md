# nexSign mini commercial license

This document explains when you need a commercial license and how to request one.

## When to purchase

The project is GPLv3 by default. Purchase a commercial license when you cannot meet the obligations of GPLv3, for example if you intend to:

- ship NSM inside a closed-source product
- embed NSM in firmware where source redistribution is not possible
- obtain commercial support, SLAs, or custom development from NDX Pty Ltd

## What the license provides

- permission to distribute NSM in proprietary products without GPLv3 obligations
- access to commercial support channels
- optional addenda covering bespoke engineering work
